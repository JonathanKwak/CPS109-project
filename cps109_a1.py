Must have all of these:
1. Conditions and decision making using if/else statements.
2. Working with sequences, such as lists, tuples, and strings.
3. Sequence iteration using for loops, general iteration using wile loops.
4. Importing namespaces, using their functions, writing your own functions.
5. Performing file I/O, reading input from a file, writing output to a file.

Problem:
Rock paper scissors is too boring. What if you could add more items?
